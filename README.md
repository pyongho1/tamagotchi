### How to play ðŸŽ®

Right after you choose your slime's name, the game will start right away. Starting from 10% of the bar, for each hunger and excitement, click on the "feed" and "play" button as fast as you can to reach 100% on the bar! As you pass 40%, 70%, and 100%, your slime will evolve into a different form of slime. Feeling lucky? Try out the "risk" button to test your luck on getting the progress bar all the way! See the last form of slime to win the game!ðŸŽŠ
